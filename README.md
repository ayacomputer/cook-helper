 ## About The Project


 ![ProductScreen Shot](./assets/product.png)

Cook helper helps users to cook and organise cooking efficiently! You can select recipes to cook and add, edit and delete recipes to customize your Cook helper. You can view several recipes at the same time and see which ingredients you need. Each step can be collapsed so you can see how far you have cooked and multitask easily.
